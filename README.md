# A Day in the Life of a SOC Analyst, IOC Triage
Recently, I received multiple suspicious files and logs from a coworker for triage. After analysis, several artifacts were confirmed as malicious including phishing campaigns, brute-force IPs, and domains linked to fraudulent activity

## Executive Summary
Threat actors continue to exploit email, brute-force attempts, and phishing domains to infiltrate organizations. As a SOC Analyst, part of my role is to validate and triage Indicators of Compromise (IOCs) shared by colleagues. This ensures we distinguish false positives from legitimate threats and take swift action to safeguard business operations.
During this investigation, multiple suspicious files and logs were analyzed. Several artifacts were confirmed as malicious, including phishing campaigns, brute-force IPs, and domains linked to fraudulent activities
